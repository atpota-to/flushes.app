Let's make a few changes.

1. I want the two steps to both be on the same page and not require a forward and backward button sort of flow.

2. Let's make it so that when you go to flushing.im the home page *is* the feed of recent updates, and there's a login button on the top right similar to the dashboard UI that we have.

3. Above the feed where the Status Update flow is, let's have it not appear by default and instead be some sort of button or simple UI that you can click and it then makes the full status UI appear, then once the status is set, it collapses again, but it can be opened back up to set a new status?

4. Let's make the status timestamp appear to the far right in the feed and the actual emoji and status appear on the far left.

5. Let's make some nice animations for things too. For instance, when the status update flow is invoked, it animates in, and the collapse is also animated smoothly. Then, when a new status is updated or shown on the feed, it animates into the top smoothly or something like that.
